This is basic implemention of the Feature selection and classification using a dataset,


 Here is the Summary of Implementation:

1. Data Loading: Load and prepare the dataset.
2. Data Visualization: Visualize key aspects of the data for initial insights.
3. Feature Selection: Use `SelectKBest` and `RFE` to select the most important features.
4. Classification Algorithms: Apply Logistic Regression and Random Forest both without feature selection and after applying `SelectKBest` and `RFE`.
5. Performance Comparison: Compare the accuracy results to evaluate the effectiveness of feature selection methods.

Note: Adjust file paths and dataset specifics as needed based on your actual environment and dataset. This structured approach provides a comprehensive view of the dataset's characteristics and the impact of different feature selection methods on classification performance.
